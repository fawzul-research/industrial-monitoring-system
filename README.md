Industrial Monitoring System: Metal Printing &amp; Alternator Detection

# Industrial Monitoring System: Metal Printing & Alternator Detection

A dual-purpose AI application developed during my internship at the Centre of Excellence (CoE), Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.  
This system integrates:
- **Real-time metal printing quality monitoring** using image classification (MobileNetV3 + PyTorch)
- **Alternator object detection** using YOLOv8

Built with Python, ONNX, Tkinter, and deployed as a standalone GUI application.

> ⚠️ Note: The training dataset used in this project was collected by my supervisor and team under institutional guidelines. For privacy and research integrity, it is **not publicly shared**. However, the code and model structure are fully available.

## 🚀 Features
- Detects defects in metal prints in real time
- Identifies industrial alternators from live camera feeds
- Integrates both models into a single GUI app using Tkinter
- Optimized for production use with ONNX model conversion
- Deployed as standalone executable via PyInstaller

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python, PyTorch, ONNX, OpenCV
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics), MobileNetV3
- Tkinter (GUI), Flask (optional backend)
- Google Colab (training), PyInstaller (deployment)
